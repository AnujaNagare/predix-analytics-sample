## Developing a Matlab-based analytic
1. Implement the Matlab analytic and corresponding unit tests according to your development guidelines.
2. Create a config.json file as shown in the [example](demo-adder-matlab-r2011b-impl/src/main/resources/config.json) and place it in the root folder.
3. Create a JAR package using either Maven build or other tools.
